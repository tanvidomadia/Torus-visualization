The denominator of an odds fraction indicates the probability that the event will not occur. If we convert the odds of event B to a probability, we get 4/14 or ~28.5%. The probability of event A is 3/10 or 30%, which is higher than the probability of event B. So, event A is more likely to occur.'}], 'id': '284403751', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '724222143'}, 'id': '4011472050', 'rule': 'input like {1334701096}', 'score': 0}, {'feedback': {'content': [{'children': [{'text': 'Incorrect'}], 'id': '3274139191', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '823186360'}, 'id': '3846300100', 'rule': 'input like {.*}', 'score': 0}], 'scoringStrategy': 'average'}], 'previewText': 'If the probability of Event A is 3/10 and the odds of Event B is 4/10, which event is more likely to occur?', 'targeted': [[['1980645113'], '2511588'], [['1334701096'], '4011472050']], 'transformations': [{'id': '3600061827', 'operation': 'shuffle', 'path': 'choices'}], 'version': 2}",[],"[{'content': [{'children': [{'text': 'Event A is more likely to occur'}], 'id': '105793268', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '3440696981'}, {'content': [{'children': [{'text': 'Event B is more likely to occur'}], 'id': '324255159', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '1980645113'}, {'content': [{'children': [{'text': 'Event A and Event B are equally likely to occur'}], 'id': '4258181583', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '1334701096'}]","{'content': [{'children': [{'text': 'If the probability of Event A is 3/10 and the odds of Event B is 4/10, which event is more likely to occur?'}], 'id': '3987489222', 'type': 'p'}], 'id': '1679483425'}",

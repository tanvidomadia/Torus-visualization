While the odds of rolling an even number is 1:1, there are multiple ways we can represent the odds. In this case, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6. So, (1 - the probability of rolling an even number) is 1-(3/6)=(3/6). The odds of the event is (3/6)/(3/6). By simplifying, we can get the ratio 3:3. By simplifying more, we can get the ratio 1:1.
